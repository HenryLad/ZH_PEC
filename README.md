ZeHenkampf PunktE Calulator


This program is a point calculator for a decathlon event. 
It allows users to input their achieved values in various track and field competitions, such as sprints, jumps, throws, and hurdles.

The program consists of two main functionalities:

    Header Input: Users can enter the name of the competition they want to calculate points for. They submit this information, and the program displays the header with the entered competition name.

    Points Calculation: After entering the competition name, users can input their achieved value (e.g., time for sprints, distance for jumps and throws). Upon submission, the program calculates and displays the points achieved by the athlete in that              particular competition, based on predefined formulas for each event.

Additionally, the program provides a dropdown menu for users to select different competitions. This menu offers a convenient way to choose the event without having to type the name manually.

The design of the program includes a responsive layout using Bootstrap for styling. It consists of a navigation bar, input forms for competition selection and achieved value input, and a section to display the calculated points. The program also includes error handling to ensure that users provide valid inputs.
